  What is Phishing?<br>
  Phishing is a kind of Social engineering online attack which is commonly used by most of the hackers.<br>
  In this they Create fake websites and trap you and then they stole the data in your device which is very dangerous.<br>
 <br>Prevention:<br>
 you can understand that which website is fake by the main page and the url of the website,<br>
   ex- Flipkart.com is the official website of flipkart but i saw a fake website in which there was written 90% discount on every product, then i thought i can buy anything in this discount and purchased a iphone but i didnt got iphone but lost my money because its fake website which trapped me and took my money by saying that your iphone will deliver soon.<br><br>
  you can also see the discount and sales of the website and understand that the website is safe and real or not.<br>
   I did a mistake but you guys dont do mistake like me, be safe and think a second before purchasing any product from any uknown website.

  What is Pretexting?<br>
  Pretexting is form of social engineering in which an attacker tries to convince a victim to give up valuable information or access to a service or system. The distinguishing feature of this kind of attack is that the scam artists comes up with a story — or pretext — in order to fool the victim.
<br><br>
In my words its generally a form of social engineering attack in which an attacker asks your personal information and<br> acts like a friend and takes access to your device and he also side by side he makes a plan to trap you
<br><br>Prevention:<br>
Dont share your personal information to any stranger in any of the social media platforms, firstly take the trust from him/her and then only talk to him.<br>
If he/she asks access to your Device or any other then denie them and tell them i can't do that and<br> if you think he/she is not a hacker and a good person then also take a trust from him/her.

 <p>
  What is Baiting?<br>
  As its name implies, baiting attacks use a false promise to pique a victim's greed or curiosity. <br>They lure users into a trap that steals their personal information or inflicts their systems with malware. The most reviled form of baiting uses physical media to disperse malware.
 <br>Prevention:<br>
 Dont trust Any stranger and if any stranger gives you promise and you think its false promise then just ignore him and don't talk to him.<br>
 many of the hackers or attackers also know your personal information by just a single message,<br> hackers can also hack your device so if you have a laptop or pc then download Avast free Antivirus to prevent hacking of your device.

 </p><br>
  <p>
   What is Quid Pro Quo?
  <br>
  Similar to baiting, quid pro quo involves a hacker requesting the exchange of critical data or login credentials in exchange for a service.<br>
  In my words, hacker sends you the link of a website which asks you to login and requests you to login in exchange for a service.<br>
  This website takes your email and password and gives it to hacker, he now can stole our personal data in our account. That website was fake and wasn't a trusted site thats why dont believe on such sites.
<br>
Prevention:<br>
Dont click on the links that some unknowm person sends you.<br>
And if clicked dont login and dont give any personal information and access to your device if the website asks you.
 </p>
 <br>
<p>
 What is Tailgating?<br>
 Our final social engineering attack type of the day is known as tailgating or “piggybacking.” In these types of attacks, someone without the proper authentication follows an authenticated employee into a restricted area. The attacker might impersonate a delivery driver and wait outside a building to get things started. When an employee gains security’s approval and opens the door, the attacker asks the employee to hold the door, thereby gaining access to the building.
 Prevention:<br>
 When you Go to your office and gain security’s approval, then if someone tells you to hold the door, then just ignore him and don't listen to the words he is telling.
